GUIDES FOR ADMINISTRA TION AND APPLICA TION OF THE RULES\\nEach official should have a definite and clear conception of their overall responsibilities. \\nIt is essential for them to know , understand and implement the rules as intended. If all  officials \\npossess the same conception, there will be a guaranteed uniformity in the administration of \\nall contests.\\nThe restrictions placed upon the player by the rules are intended to create a balance \\nof play , equal opportunity for the defense and the offense, provide reasonable safety and \\nprotection for all players and emphasize cleverness and skill without unduly limiting freedom \\nof action of player or team.\\nThe purpose of penalties is to compensate a player who has been placed at a disadvantage \\nthrough an illegal act of an opponent and to restrain players from committing acts  which, \\nif ignored, might lead to roughness even though they do not affect the immediate  play .\\nII. BASIC PRINCIPLES\\nA. CONTACT SITUATIONS\\n1. Incidental Contact\\nThe mere fact that contact occurs does not necessarily constitute a foul. Contact which \\nis incidental to an effort by a player to play an opponent, reach a loose ball, or perform \\nnormal defensive or offensive movements, should not be considered illegal. If, however, a \\nplayer attempts to play an opponent from a position where he has no reasonable chance to \\nperform without making contact with his opponent, the responsibility is on the player in this \\nposition.'),\n",

Therefore, \\ncontact on that part of the hand by a defender while it is in contact with the ball is not illegal.\\n2. Guarding an Opponent\\nIn all guarding situations, a player is entitled to any spot on the court he desires, \\nprovided he legally gets to that spot first and without contact with an opponent. If a defensive \\nor offensive player has established a position on the floor and his opponent initiates contact \\nthat results in the dislodging of the opponent, a foul should be called IMMEDIATELY .\\nDuring all throw-ins, the defensive player(s) must be allowed to take a position \\nbetween his man and the basket.\\nA player may continue to move after gaining a guarding position in the path of an \\nopponent provided he is not moving directly or obliquely toward his opponent when contact \\noccurs.
